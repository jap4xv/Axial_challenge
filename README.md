# Buyer Search

You can simply run the program in the command line with the following code

`python find_matches.py <Buyer ID>`

The script will print out a ranked list of buyers and their match scores. Buyers match scores are determined 
by the total number of geography and industry ids shared between the seller and buyer. Higher ranked buyers
share more geography and industry ids than lower ranked buyers.
